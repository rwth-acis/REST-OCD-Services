"Calculate influence $\mathbf{F}$";"The influence value $\mathbf{F}$ for a node $u \in V$ is determined by the following formula: \begin{align} \mathbf{F}(u) = \sum_{v \in N(u), v \neq u} \frac{D(u) \cdot (1+ \mathbf{C}(u)) \cdot D(v) \cdot (1+ \mathbf{C}(v))}{(1- \mathbf{sim}(u, v))^2} \end{align} Here $D(u) := | N(u) |$ is the degree, i.e. the number of neighbors of $u \in V$. Furthermore, $\mathbf{sim}(u, v) := \frac{|N(u) \cap N(v)|}{|N(u) \cup N(v)|}$ describes the similarity of node $u$ to node $v$. Finally, $\mathbf{C}(u)$ describes the local clustering coefficient between the neighbors of node $u \in V$. We compute $\mathbf{C}(u)$ as follows: \begin{align} \mathbf{C}(u)= \begin{cases} \frac{2 \cdot \mathbf{K}(u)}{D(u) \cdot (D(u) -1)} & \text{if}\  D(u) \neq 1 \\ 0 & \text{if}\ D(u) = 1 \end{cases} \end{align} Here $\mathbf{K}(u)$ is the number of connections between the neighboring nodes of $u \in V$."
"Maximal influence $\mathbf{F}$ in neighborhood";"All nodes $v$ with maximum $\mathbf{F}$ value in their own neighborhood $N(v) := \{ u \in V \ | \ (v, u) \in E \}$ are considered as candidate central nodes."
"Similarity less than $\alpha$";"To achieve a good community division in the network, it is important that connections within the same community are more distinct than between different communities. For this, all candidate central nodes are compared with the already recognized central nodes based on node similarity $\mathbf{sim}$ and only added to the central nodes set $\mathbf{CN}$ if the similarity is smaller than a threshold $\alpha$. In other words: If $\mathbf{sim}(u, v) \leq \alpha$ for $u \in \mathbf{CN}$ and $v$ is a candidate central node, then $\mathbf{CN} \leftarrow \mathbf{CN} \cup \{ v \}$."
"Maximal $\mathbf{F}$ and similarity less than $\alpha$";"All nodes $n$ with $F(n) \geq F(N(n))$ and $sim(n, v) \leq \alpha$ for $v \in \mathbf{CN}$ are part of the final central node set $\mathbf{CN}$."
"Average similarity of central node";"The average similarity can be calculated as follows: \begin{align} \mathbf{ave_{sim}}(u) := \frac{1}{D(u)} \cdot \sum_{v \in N(u)} \mathbf{sim}(u, v) \end{align} which represents the average similarity between central node $u \in \mathbf{CN}$ and its neighboring nodes."
"Create central edge sets $\mathbf{CES}$";"All central nodes $u \in \mathbf{CN}$ are expanded with the edges satisfying the following and become part of the central edge set $\mathbf{CE}$ of $u$: \begin{align} \mathbf{CE} = \{ (u, v) \in E \ | \ u\in \mathbf{CN} \text{ and } \mathbf{sim}(u, v) > \mathbf{ave_{sim}}(u) \} \end{align} Thus, we can derive that each central node corresponds to exactly one central edge set."
"Non-central edges $\mathbf{NCE}$";"All remaining nodes, which are not added to a central edge set in the previous step, are called non-central edges $\mathbf{NCE}$."
"Adding $\mathbf{NCE}$ to $\mathbf{CES}$";"In the previous step, there are several remaining non-central edges $\mathbf{NCE}$. To assign them suitably to the central edge sets $\mathbf{CES}$ we proceed as follows. First, we calculate the distance between the edges of the graph. For this we use the following formula: \begin{align} \mathbf{Dis}(a, b) = \mathbf{Jacard}(a, b) \cdot \mathbf{link}(a, b) \end{align} Here $\mathbf{Jacard}(a, b)$ is the Jacard distance between $a$ and $b$ with $a=(a_1, a_2), b=(b_1, b_2) \in E$ two edges of the graph. \begin{align} \mathbf{Jacard}(a, b) := 1 - \frac{|\big(N(a_1) \cup N(a_2) \big) \cap \big(N(b_1) \cup N(b_2) \big)|}{|N(a_1) \cup N(a_2) \cup N(b_1) \cup N(b_2)|} \end{align} Also, $\mathbf{link}(a, b)$ is the topological distance of edges which describes the shortest path in the graph from edge $a$ to edge $b$. We defined $\mathbf{link}(a, b)$ as follows: \begin{align} \mathbf{link}(a, b) := \text{ shortest path from edge } a \text{ to edge } b \end{align} After we have determined the distances from all edges to each other, we determine the average distances $\mathbf{DLS}(e, \mathbf{CE})$ from the non-central edges $e$ to all central edge sets $\mathbf{CE}$. \begin{align} \mathbf{DLS}(e, \mathbf{CE}) = \frac{1}{| \mathbf{CE} |} \cdot \sum_{v \in \mathbf{CE}} \mathbf{Dis}(e, v)\end{align} The non-central edges are assigned to the central edge sets with the smallest average distance."
"Create current communities";"The central edge set $\mathbf{CE}$ is transformed to its corresponding community $\mathbf{C}$ as follows: \begin{align} \mathbf{C} = \{ v \in V \ | \ e = (e_1, e_2) \in \mathbf{CE}, \ v = e_1 \ \lor v = e_2 \} \end{align}"
"Mark overlapping nodes $\mathbf{ON}$";"If several edges connected to a node $v$ belong to several communities at the same time, this node $v$ can be considered as an overlapping node and is added to the set of overlapping nodes $\mathbf{ON}$."
"Remove $\mathbf{ON}$s from communities";"Since there are many overlapping nodes in the last step, the NLC algorithm try to optimize the $\mathbf{ON}$ set. For this it adjust the overlapping nodes in each community. Therefore, the non-overlapping nodes were considered as the divided parts, and the community was improved by constantly reducing redundant overlapping nodes. For this, the ratio of the connections between the nodes $n \in \mathbf{ON}$ and the subdivided areas in each community was determined. If the ratio is smaller than a pruning threshold $prune$, the overlapping node is no longer considered part of the corresponding community. In mathematical terms: \begin{align} \frac{con(n, {\mathbf{NonOverlap}_j})}{\sum_{k \in clus(n)} con(n, {\mathbf{NonOverlap}_k})} < prune \end{align} where overlapping node $n$ does not occur in community $j$, $\mathbf{NonOverlap_j}$ is the set of non-overlapping nodes in community $j$, $con(n, \mathbf{NonOverlap_j})$ is the number of connections between $n$ and the non-overlapping part of community $j$ and $clus(n)$ represents all communities to which node $n$ belonged in the previous step."
"Result of NLC Algorithm";"This is the final result of the neighboring local clustering algorithm."

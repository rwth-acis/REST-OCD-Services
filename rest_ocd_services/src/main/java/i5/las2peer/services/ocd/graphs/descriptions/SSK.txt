"Calculate influence matrix $A'$";"The influence matrix $A'$ is defined as follows: \begin{align} A_{ji}' := A_{ji} + \sum_{k \in V \setminus \{ i, j \} } C_{ji}^k = A_{ji} + \sum_{k \in V \{ i, j \} } min \{ A_{ki}, A_{jk} \} \end{align} where $C_{ji}^k$ is the transitive link weight from node $i$ to node $j$ through node $k$ and $A_{ji} = 1 \Leftrightarrow$ edge $(j, i) \in E$."
"Calculate transition matrix $T$";"The transition matrix $T$ is defined as follows: \begin{align} T_{ij} := \frac{ A_{ij}' }{ \sum_{k \in V \setminus \{ i, j \} } A_{kj}' } \end{align} where entry $T_{ij}$ denotes the relative influence node $i$ has on node $j$ and also represents the probability to jump from node $i$ to node $j$ for the random walk (next step)."
"Calculate overall influence $x_i^*$ for every node";"The next step is calculating the overall influence $x_i^*$ of every node $i$ in the network. The overall influence $x_i^*$ represents how important is the opinion of node $i$ in the network, i.e., how much its opinion spreads through the network. As a process for modeling the influence spreading in the network, we consider the unbiased random walk where, at each step, a walker at node $j$ follows one of the outgoing links proportionally to the linkâ€™s weight $A_{ij}'$. Writing $x(t) = [x_1(t) \ x_2(t) \ ... \ x_N(t)]$, where $x_i(t)$ is the overall influence of node $i$ at time $t$, the expected density of walkers evolves according to the rate equation: $x(t+1) = T \cdot x(t)$ (1). We start with initial vector $x(0) = [ \frac{1}{N} \ \frac{1}{N} \ ... \ \frac{1}{N}]$. The overall influences $x_i^*$ is a steady-state solution of (1) and can be obtained for directed networks only numerically by iterating (1), that is, when time $t$ goes to infinity. In a special case when the network is undirected and non-bipartite, there is a known analytical solution for $x_i^*$: \begin{align} x_i^* = \sum_{j} A_{ij}' / \sum_{jk} A_{kj}' \end{align}"
"Identify neighbors with largest relative influence on node";"The neighbors with largest relative influence on node $i$ are defined as follows: \begin{align} \Gamma_i = \big\{ j \ | \ T_{ji} = max_k \{ k \ | \ T_{ki} \} \big\} \end{align}"
"Determine the product of relative influence and overall influence";"We calculate $T_{ij} \cdot x_i^*$ for all $j \in \Gamma_i$ and write the results on edge $(i, j) \in E$. We also determine $T_{ji} \cdot x_j^*$ for $max_j \{ j \ | \ T_{ji} \}$ and write the results on node $j \in V$."
"Identify all leader nodes";"Node $i$ is a leader if: \begin{align} T_{ij} \cdot x_i^* > T_{ji} \cdot x_j^* \text{ for all } j \in \Gamma_i \end{align}"
"Assign leaders to their community";"Note that in the rare cases where two or more leaders are also most influential neighbors between each other, (that is, when $T_{ij} \cdot x_i^* = T_{ji} \cdot x_j^*$), than they are grouped together and are becoming leaders of the same community."
"Nodes involved to the following communities";"Let $L$ be the number of communities that are determined in the previous step, then node $i$ is involved in community $j$, iff $y_i(j) > \frac{1}{L}$, where $y_i$ is the membership vector of node $i$ and is calculated as follows: \begin{align} y_i(t+1) = \frac{1}{ \sum_{j} A_{ji}} \sum_{j} A_{ji} y_j(t) \end{align} For every leader $l_i$, the initial membership vector $y_{l_i}(0)$ has all components equal to zero, except for the $i$-th component to one. For every node $j$ that is not a leader, all components of $y_j(0)$ are initialized to $\frac{1}{L}$ to denote equal participation to each community. At each time step, the membership vector of each node is updated by computing a weighted average of the membership vectors of its neighbors."
"Assign node to community with maximal membership value";"Node $i$ is assigned to the community leader $l_j$ with maximal membership value, in other words node $i$ is assigned to community $max_j \{ j \ | \ y_i(l_j) \}$."
"Result of SSK Algorithm";"This is the final result of the SSK algorithm."
